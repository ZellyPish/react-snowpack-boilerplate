#### Package Install Quick Fix

after `yarn pkginstall @emotion/react`, `snowpack.deps.json` has below codes.

```json
// snowpack.deps.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "": "emotion/react"
  },
  "lock": {
    "#emotion/react": "@emotion/react@v11.1.4-0pm4g5UyI3uyXjpEWZEZ",
  }

```

Editing this codes to

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@emotion/react": "^11.1.4"
  },
  "lock": {
    "@emotion/react#^11.1.4": "@emotion/react@v11.1.4-0pm4g5UyI3uyXjpEWZEZ"
